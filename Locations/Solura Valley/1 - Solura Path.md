# Solura Path

A cobblestone path leading down a grassy valley, stone ruins half-buried in the ground scattered about. At the bottom of the valley, a Y-shaped river flows, with two bridges crossing it. The left bridge has a path leading to the School House, and the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs. 

The Handler can be found in the middle of the path, awaiting Nilo's arrival. They give Nilo a strange umbrella, and warns them of rainy days ahead. The umbrella is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World, and is the player's main weapon.

At the bottom of the path, Lanternflies can be found, creatures born from Nilo's fear of bugs. The path leads to the Y-shaped river, where the left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy. Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.
