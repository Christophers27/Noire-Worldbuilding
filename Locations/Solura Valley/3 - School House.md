# Schoolyard Exterior

The Schoolyard Exterior is the final outdoor section of the first chapter. A field similar to those of Solura Path, and Solura Cliffs, the biggest differences are the presence of playground equipment, and a large schoolhouse towards the top of the hill.

# Classroom

The Classroom is the first bossfight arena. When Nilo first walks in, the room is found in diusorder, with desks swept to the sides of the room.
