# Bedrock Plains

Bedrock Plains is the home base of Nilo. Nilo first wakes up there and will typically return to this area after a chapter of the game. The environment is a mystical floating island which incorporates elements of Nilo's bedroom scattered about the environment. Starting off simple, each time Nilo returns to Bedrock Plains, elements from previous levels will return along with them.
