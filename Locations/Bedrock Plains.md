# Bedrock Plains

A small area in the edge of Nilo's island of consciousness. The walls and floor of Nilo's bedroom, drawn from their memories, lie strewn about the area. It serves as a hub area where some NPCs and maybe work stations can be found as the player progresses through the game.

The scene of Nilo's bedroom shows its messy state, with clothes and other items scattered around. It reflects Nilo's state of mind, and as the game progresses, the room will become cleaner and more organized, reflecting Nilo's growth.

(Tentative): A small blocked off corner of the area could be a fast travel point to Level 3 or further areas, unlocked after clearing those levels.
