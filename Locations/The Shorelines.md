# The Shorelines

A secret area in Nilo's island, the Shorelines line its edges. The river seen in Solura Path flows down here, turning into a beautiful waterfall that cascades into the foggy sea. A tranquil, peaceful place for the player to relax, and a place for Nilo to reflect on their thoughts. 

A few non-hostile creatures can be found here, as well as a hidden cave that leads to a secret item.
