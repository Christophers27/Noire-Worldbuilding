# Cake
Cake! Dad also had a slice, only 3 slices were cut out. 

# Balloons
The cat was terrified of the balloons, as they slowly deflated lower and lower to the ground during the week
following the party.

# Gift Table
One gift, only one gift, a stuffed bear named Djungelskog. 

# Drawer
Shuffling through the trinkets and tools, a sewing kit reveals itself.
