# Journal

"An old, worn leather journal, detailing Nilo's journey in the Dream World."

An old, worn leather journal, found by Nilo in the School House. For whatever reason, Nilo felt compelled to begin documenting their journey in the journal, writing about the strange and fantastical creatures and people they met on their way. They've also decided to write their tasks there, having read somewhere that writing a task list helps with procrastination.

**Functions**

- Enemy Log: When a new enemy is encountered, a new page will be written in the journal, with a quick sketch and description of it.
- NPC Log: When a new NPC is encountered, a new page will be written in the journal, with a quick sketch and description of them.
- Story Log: When interacting with limited specific objects, a new page will be written, these pages function as diary enties, and may include a sketch or thought.
- Tasks: Details the current and past tasks that Nilo has to do. This includes the main story quest and side quests.
