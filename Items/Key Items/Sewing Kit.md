# Sewing Kit

Found in the Birthday Room, this kit is used to repair Svartskogen and other torn fabrics around the Dream World. Not disimilar to sewing materials from reality, the only visible difference is the unnatural glowing nature of the thread.

## Functions

- Store Threads: When Nilo receives dream threads from defeating enemies, it's stock will be displayed alongside the sewing kit.

- Sew: When Nilo comes across any tear in the reality of the dreamword, he can spend dream threads to seal the tear. This allows for players to unlock secrets, items, upgrades, etc.
