# Old Note

You see a piece of paper on the ground. A hastily scrawled note is written on it.

**Functions**

- Read: "If you're reading this, then my Shard has found you. This is the Dream World, the place I told you I had my adventures in when we were kids. This is real, and the monsters are real too. It's dangerous, but the First Layer should be safe enough for you to get your bearings. I'm stuck far below. I'm sorry for what I did, and I hope you can forgive me. My Shard is fading away, I can't write much. Trace my steps, follow the clues. - Your old friend"
