# Rules of the Dream World

## Dreamers

The Dream World is a mysterious realm, where everyone goes when they fall asleep. Upon entering this world, they find themselves in the First Layer, within their own island. There, the world around them transforms, mirroring the intricate tapestry of their subconscious mind, shaped by their thoughts, emotions, and memories. It is a place where the mind's innermost thoughts and desires are made manifest as vibrant landscapes, where Aspects of their self become separate entities.
