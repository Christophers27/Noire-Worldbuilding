# Endings

## Ending 1: Dreamer's End

Nilo decides to leave the Dream World with Florence, letting the Dream World fade away. The Handler, desperate to keep the Dream World alive, will be the final boss, and will try to stop Nilo from leaving. If the Handler is defeated, Nilo and Florence will leave, and the Dream World is consumed by the fog. Nilo and Florence, having decided to forget the Dream World, live their lives in the Waking World, and the Dream World, finally forgotten, is no more. Sometimes, however, Nilo and Florence will feel like they're missing something, and can't shake the feeling that they've forgotten something important.

## Ending 2: Eternal Vigil

This ending occurs if Nilo is defeated by the Handler while trying to leave. Having been defeated, Nilo is seized by the Handler, being made to remain and keep the Dream World alive by remembering its existence. Florence manages to escape, and lives her life in the Waking World, but is unable to forget Nilo. She has forgotten about the Dream World, but sometimes, she feels like she's missing something, and can't shake the feeling that she's forgotten something important. Nilo, meanwhile, accepts their fate, and keeps the crumbling husk of a fallen world alive, forever.

## Ending 3: Rebirth

Nilo and Florence have decided to move on from their regretful past, and let the Dream World of the past move on as well. The Handler, still desperate to keep the Dream World alive, will be the final boss, and also tries to stop Nilo and Florence from erasing the final remnants of the old Dream World. (Some other NPC) will also appear, and be the second phase of the final boss. If they are both defeated, Nilo and Florence will have the fog consume the Dream World, but while staying there, the fog will eventually clear, and a new, vibrant Dream World will be born. Nilo and Florence, by (something they did in the final boss room), will finally leave the Dream World, having moved on from their past, and the new Dream World, no longer reliant on humanity's memory, will start anew.
