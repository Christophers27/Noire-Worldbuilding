# Main Story

Once, there was a dreamer, who dreamed of adventure. She discovered, early in her life, that she could go wherever she pleased in the Dream World, while everyone she knew seemed confined to the First Layer, where they experienced their dreams every night.

She took to the dream world as an adventurer, exploring its vast, mysterious depths, seeing its myriad sights. Every night was a new adventure, and she delighted in her secret ability that no one else seemed to have. But her fantastical adventures in the Dream World made the Waking World seem dull by comparison, and she found it difficult to relate to the people who lived ordinary, boring lives in her eyes. She grew detached to the Waking World, since she was much happier in the Dream World.

Eventually, this caused a conflict between her and her closest friend, Nilo, who was concerned by her detachment. This conflict only caused her to lean more on the Dream World to escape her own issues. She grew more distant and detached, and more reckless in the Dream World. Eventually, the day came when her reckless adventuring caused her to be trapped by a nightmare beast, deep in the lower depths of the Dream World. She was unable to return to the Waking World.

In the Waking World, she fell into a deep coma, and Nilo was devastated by this. They looked for many ways to wake her up, but as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, they began to lose hope. Eventually, Nilo gave up, moving on with their life, forever haunted by the loss of their closest friend.

Meanwhile, in the Dream World, the Fellow Dreamer had much time to reflect on her actions, and in a last-ditch attempt to escape and reconcile with her friend, she sent a Shard of her soul to find Nilo and bring them to the Dream World.

Weak as she was, her Shard could barely reach Nilo and bring them to the Dream World. The Shard could only leave a hastily scrawled note, making sure that Nilo was ready for the journey ahead, and then it was gone. The note only spoke of where Nilo was, a few rules of the Dream World, and that Nilo's old friend was below.

Nilo arrived in the First Layer, confused and disoriented. The note said little, and they wandered the Dream World, learning more about how it worked, and how to navigate it. As they explored, they began to come across traces of their old friend, things she left behind, people she had met, and places she had been. Nilo began to piece together what had happened, who left the note, and where they should go. The Fellow Dreamer, their old friend who they thought was lost forever, was waiting for them, deep in the depths of the Dream World. Nilo found hope, for the first time in a long time, and began their journey to find their old friend.
