# Summary

## Plot

Main charactes is known as The Dreamer. They are currently a young adult with low self-confidence and a lot of regrets in life. They made friends with the Fellow Dreamer as a child, who they looked up to.

The Fellow Dreamer has a (as far as she knows) unique ability to be lucid in the Dream World and travel wherever she pleases. She is adventurous and reckless, due to her seemingly unique ability and having powers in the Dream World.

Her reckless behavior eventually caused a conflict between her and The Dreamer. She became distant and detached from the Waking World, spending more time in the Dream World and becoming more reckless. Eventually, she was bested by a foul nightmare, and became stuck in the Dream World. She fell into a coma in the Waking World, and The Dreamer was devastated by this.

After some time, the Fellow Dreamer reflected on her actions, and sent a Shard of her soul to find The Dreamer and bring them to the Dream World. The Shard could only leave a hastily scrawled note with little information before it faded away. Now, The Dreamer is in the Dream World, lucid and able to explore it, and has some vague idea of what's going on.

The Dreamer will explore the Dream World, and gradually piece together what happened to their old friend, and where to go. They will face their fears and regrets, and gradually become more confident and self-assured over time.

## Setting

The Dream World is where the game takes place. It's a mysterious realm where people go when they fall asleep. They appear in the First Layer, in their own island. The world around them transforms to mirror their subconscious mind, and they experience their dreams there. Most people are not lucid in the Dream World, and only ever stay in their island in the First Layer, experiencing their dreams.

Every time someone wakes up and they forget their dreams, the things related to those dreams 'shatter' and fall into the lower layers of the Dream World. While the islands in the First Layer separate people from each other, the lower layers are connected. 

There can be 'Shards' from the shattered dreams/nightmares, which are just pieces of pure imagination. These are used as currency for the creatures that live in the Dream World. 

'Aspects' are more intact pieces of dreams/nightmares, which are mixtures of people's thoughts, emotions, and memories. They are creatures in dreams/nightmares that remain intact after the dreamer wakes up, and are the inhabitants of the Dream World. They can be friendly or hostile, depending on what they represent.
