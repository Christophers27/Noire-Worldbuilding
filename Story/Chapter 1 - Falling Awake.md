# Chapter 1

## Bedrock Plains

- Nilo, the player character, wakes up in the Bedrock Plains, in the First Layer of the Dream World.
- They find a note, left by the Fellow Dreamer, telling them where they are, and that she is stuck in the lower layers
  - Nilo suspects that the writer of the note is their old friend, but doesn't get their hopes up.
- Exploring the Bedrock Plains and interacting with the items reveals some background about the Fellow Dreamer and what happened to her.
  - The tone of the text is somewhat melancholic, as Nilo has many unresolved regrets and issues from the past.
  - The messy room reflects Nilo's state of mind.
- Nilo finds a door, which leads to the next area, Solura Valley.

## Solura Valley

### Solura Path

- Nilo finds themself at the top of a cobblestone path, leading down into a valley.
- Halfway down the path, Nilo meets a mysterious figure, who comments that there might be rainy days ahead, and gives them an umbrella.
  - The umbrella is the player's main weapon, and is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World.
  - Dev note: Might change umbrella to something else in the future, or maybe not.
- Following the path, they first encounter the first enemy type, the Lanternfly.
  - This is the combat tutorial.
  - Nilo is afraid of bugs, but begins to overcome their fear.
    - Use shaky screen maybe? And have Nilo comment on it in the enemy description?
- After several more Lanternflies, the path leads to a Y-shaped river and two bridges. The left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy.
  - Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.
- Going down the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs area.

### Solura Cliffs

- There are cliff houses built into the cliffs, where the player can find the sewing kit, and an empty sheep pen at the side for an optional side quest to find all the sheep.
  - The sheep are scattered around the area, and are hidden in various places.
- The path from the bridge fades into just grass, so the player is free to explore the area.
  - There are enemies in the area, and introduces the second enemy type, the Eyeball.
- Progressing to the cliff houses, there are several which can be entered.
  - The cliff houses will show scenes of Nilo's past for some background.
    - Dev note: Other than main house, other houses show cutscenes or text only? Reduce need for modeling rooms.
  - The main house will show a scene of Nilo's birthday party, where only the Fellow Dreamer showed up.
    - Some items in the house can be interacted with, and will show some text about Nilo's past.
    - The real Svartskogen toy can be found there.
- After obtaining the sewing kit, the player can return to the Svartskogen and repair it.
  - The Svartskogen will then move out of the way, and the player can progress to the next area, the School House.
  - The Svartskogen will disappear once out of view, and can be found in the hub area, the Bedrock Plains.
