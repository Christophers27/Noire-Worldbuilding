# Level 1: Solura Island

Solura Island is Nilo's island of consciousness, floating in the foggy sea of the Dream World. This is where the game begins. The island's theme is childhood, and the areas are drawn from Nilo's memories and experiences from that time.

## Solura Path

A cobblestone path leads down a grassy valley, stone ruins half-buried in the ground scattered about. At the bottom of the valley, a Y-shaped river flows, with two bridges crossing it. The left bridge has a path leading to the School House, and the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs.

The Handler can be found in the middle of the path, awaiting Nilo's arrival. They give Nilo a strange umbrella, and warns them of rainy days ahead (haha get it). The umbrella is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World, and is the player's main weapon.

At the bottom of the path, Lanternflies can be found, creatures born from Nilo's fear of bugs. The path leads to the Y-shaped river, where the left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy. Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.

---

- Nilo finds themself at the top of a cobblestone path, leading down into a valley.
- Halfway down the path, Nilo meets a mysterious figure (the Handler), who comments that there might be rainy days ahead, and gives them an umbrella.
  - The umbrella is the player's main weapon, and is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World.
  - The Handler theme first plays here.
  - Nearby, there are some plants that sort of look like hands, which will be used later on to foreshadow his presence.
- Following the path, they first encounter the first enemy type, the Lanternfly.
  - This is the combat tutorial.
  - Nilo is afraid of bugs, but begins to overcome their fear.
    - Use shaky screen maybe? And have Nilo comment on it in the enemy description?
- After several more Lanternflies, the path leads to a Y-shaped river and two bridges. The left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy.
  - Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.
- Going down the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs area.

### Bridge to University Ruins

A forlorn, broken bridge hangs over the path to the school house. It leads out of the island itself, descending down into the foggy sea of the Dream World. A large gap in the bridge prevents Nilo from crossing, and the Handler will appear to give Nilo a pair of shoes for a dash ability, allowing them to cross the bridge.

## Solura Cliffs

A large, open area with imposing cliffs, dotted with houses built into the rock. The Solura Cliffs is the second area of the Solura Valley, and is where the player can find the sewing kit to repair the Svartskogen, and an optional side quest to find all the sheep for an empty sheep pen at the side of the cliff houses. The sheep are scattered around the area, and are hidden in various places.

Enemies hide amongst trees along the path to the cliffs, and the player can find the second enemy type, the Eyeball, in the area. Within the cliff houses are scenes of Nilo's past, and the main house will show a scene of Nilo's birthday party, where only the Fellow Dreamer showed up.

The player can also use a grappling hook, found later in the game, to explore reach the top of the cliffs and explore a hidden area.

---

- There are cliff houses built into the cliffs, where the player can find the sewing kit, and an empty sheep pen at the side for an optional side quest to find all the sheep.
  - The sheep are scattered around the area, and are hidden in various places.
- The path from the bridge fades into just grass, so the player is free to explore the area.
  - There are enemies in the area, and introduces the second enemy type, the Eyeball.
- Progressing to the cliff houses, there are several which can be entered.
  - The cliff houses will show scenes of Nilo's past for some background.
    - Dev note: Other than main house, other houses show cutscenes or text only? Reduce need for modeling rooms.
  - The main house will show a scene of Nilo's birthday party, where only the Fellow Dreamer showed up.
    - Some items in the house can be interacted with, and will show some text about Nilo's past.
    - The real Svartskogen toy can be found there.
- After obtaining the sewing kit, the player can return to the Svartskogen and repair it.
  - The Svartskogen will then move out of the way, and the player can progress to the next area, the School House.
  - The Svartskogen will disappear once out of view, and can later be found in the hub area, the Bedrock Plains.

### Clifftop

A hidden area at the top of the cliffs, accessible by using a grappling hook to parkour up the cliff houses. A beautiful view of the island and the sea can be seen from here, and the player can find a hidden item.

---

- A grappling hook is required to reach this area.
  - Dev Note: Maybe put the grappling hook in level 3? I'm not sure about the implementation of making the map visible from here. Is this possible?

## Schoolyard

An old gate, intricate patterns swirling about the iron, blocks the way to the school yard, a gap bent in the bars. Past the gate, a path leads through a copse of trees, to a playground with an old, hunched-over tree set in the middle. The School House looms over the yard, just beyond the playground, and the Shadow Cave lies at the edge of the yard, set into the cliffside. Atop the schoolhouse sits a metal bird, rotating as the wind blows. Somehow, even when facing away, it feels as though the bird maintains a steady watch over the yard.

---

- The Elite Lanternfly can be found here, hiding atop the lamp posts and in the trees.
- The area is meant to evoke a sense of nostalgia, the carefree days of childhood, and is blanketed in warm hues.

### Shadow Cave

A strangely dark cave pokes into the cliffside, and a shadowy enemy hides in the darkness. The player is unable to see in the cave, and a light is needed to explore it.

---

- The enemy is a shadow-type enemy, unable to be damaged by the umbrella. The Lantern is required to defeat it.
- The player might be able to explore a small part of the cave, but they cannot see in the darkness.
  - Some light source is needed to see in the cave.
- The cave is an optional side area, filled with lore and items. Nearly impossible to explore without a light source, it is encouraged the player does not enter upon first encounter.

### Schoolhouse

Nilo's old school house, dredged from unpleasant memories. Dark narrow halls close in claustrophobically, and echoes of mocking laughter can be heard here. Overturned chairs and tables lay strewn in the classrooms, as if a tornado had blown through.

---

- The school house is meant to convey discomfort and fear to the player. Enemies are infrequent and may jumpscape the player when they appear.
- There are several interactable items that indicate Nilo's unpleasant experience in school, with several bullies occasionally bothering Nilo.
  - Maybe drop some more hints of Nilo and Florence's relationship? Maybe how Florence stood up for Nilo against bullies?

### Classroom

The Handler will test Nilo here, shadowy, grasping, inhuman hands bursting through the windows to batter at Nilo. Nilo will have to prove themselves ready to face the dangers in the Dream World.

---

- A classroom at the end of the hall is the boss arena, where the Handler will test Nilo.
  - The tables and chairs in this room are swept to the corners, and the room is larger than the others.
  - The fight with the Handler is foreshadowed by the music theme of the Handler starting to play as Nilo gets closer to the classroom, and also potted plants that sort of look like hands appearing in the hallway, the same that were seen in the first meeting of the Handler.
- The boss fight starts with the Handler's arms bursting through the windows, swiping at Nilo.
  - After two phases, the arms will retract and the Handler will show themselves, explaining that they were testing Nilo.
  - They tell Nilo that the one who wrote the note is the Fellow Dreamer, and points Nilo to the next area and level of the game, the bridge to University Ruins.
- The Handler will give Nilo a pair of shoes for a dash ability, allowing them to cross the bridge.
  - The bridge is in Solura Path.
  - The Handler will disappear once out of view.

## The Shorelines (Hidden Area)

A hidden area unlocked by having a key item from some later level (we'll decide this later). A small, peaceful beach lies at the edge of the island, where the river seen earlier flows off the edge of the island as a waterfall. (Tentative): This area is on the other side of the cliffs.
