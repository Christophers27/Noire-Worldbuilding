# Level 1: Solura Island

Solura Island is Nilo's island of consciousness, floating in the foggy sea of the Dream World. This is where the game begins. The island's theme is childhood, and the areas are drawn from Nilo's memories and experiences from that time.

## Bedrock Plains (Hub Area)

A small area in the edge of Nilo's island of consciousness. The walls and floor of Nilo's bedroom, drawn from their memories, lie strewn about the area. It serves as a hub area where some NPCs can be found as the player progresses through the game.

The scene of Nilo's bedroom shows its messy state, with clothes and other items scattered around. It reflects Nilo's state of mind, and as the game progresses, the room will become cleaner and more organized, reflecting Nilo's growth.

(Tentative): A small blocked off corner of the area could be a fast travel point to Level 3 or further areas, unlocked after clearing those levels.

(Tentative): If some sort of crafting/item management system is added to the game, maybe we can put workstations here?

- Nilo, the player character, wakes up in the Bedrock Plains, in the First Layer of the Dream World.
- They find a note, left by the Fellow Dreamer, telling them where they are, and that she is stuck in the lower layers
  - Nilo suspects that the writer of the note is their old friend, but doesn't get their hopes up.
- Exploring the Bedrock Plains and interacting with the items reveals some background about the Fellow Dreamer and what happened to her.
  - The tone of the text is somewhat melancholic, as Nilo has many unresolved regrets and issues from the past.
  - The messy room reflects Nilo's state of mind.
- Nilo finds a door, which leads to the next area, Solura Valley.

## Solura Path (Area 1)

A cobblestone path leads down a grassy valley, stone ruins half-buried in the ground scattered about. At the bottom of the valley, a Y-shaped river flows, with two bridges crossing it. The left bridge has a path leading to the School House, and the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs.

The Handler can be found in the middle of the path, awaiting Nilo's arrival. They give Nilo a strange umbrella, and warns them of rainy days ahead (haha get it). The umbrella is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World, and is the player's main weapon.

At the bottom of the path, Lanternflies can be found, creatures born from Nilo's fear of bugs. The path leads to the Y-shaped river, where the left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy. Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.

---

- Nilo finds themself at the top of a cobblestone path, leading down into a valley.
- Halfway down the path, Nilo meets a mysterious figure, who comments that there might be rainy days ahead, and gives them an umbrella.
  - The umbrella is the player's main weapon, and is enchanted to be able to damage creatures of the Dream World.
- Following the path, they first encounter the first enemy type, the Lanternfly.
  - This is the combat tutorial.
  - Nilo is afraid of bugs, but begins to overcome their fear.
    - Use shaky screen maybe? And have Nilo comment on it in the enemy description?
- After several more Lanternflies, the path leads to a Y-shaped river and two bridges. The left bridge is blocked by the Svartskogen, a large anthromorphic figure resembling Nilo's childhood toy.
  - Speaking to the Svartskogen gives the player some vague hints about where they are, some background about Nilo's past, and a quest to find a sewing kit in order to repair the Svartskogen and unblock the bridge.
- Going down the right bridge leads to the Solura Cliffs area.

### Bridge to University Ruins (Sub-Area)

A forlorn, broken bridge hangs over the path to the school house. It leads out of the island itself, descending down into the foggy sea of the Dream World. A large gap in the bridge prevents Nilo from crossing, and the Handler will appear to give Nilo a pair of shoes for a dash ability, allowing them to cross the bridge.

## Solura Cliffs (Area 2)

A large, open area with imposing cliffs, dotted with houses built into the rock. The Solura Cliffs is the second area of the Solura Valley, and is where the player can find the sewing kit to repair the Svartskogen, and an optional side quest to find all the sheep.

Enemies hide amongst trees along the path to the cliffs, and the player can find the second enemy type, the Eyeball, in the area. Within the cliff houses are scenes of Nilo's past, and the main house will show a scene of Nilo's birthday party, where only the Fellow Dreamer showed up.

The Solura Cliffs is also where the player can find the sewing kit to repair the Svartskogen, and an optional side quest to find all the sheep. The sheep are scattered around the area, and are hidden in various places.

A strange cave at the edge of the cliffs is blocked by a shadow-type enemy, unable to be damaged by the umbrella. A light-based weapon from Level 2 is needed to explore this side area.

The player can also use a grappling hook, found later in the game, to explore reach the top of the cliffs and explore a hidden area.

---

- Progressing to the cliff houses, there are several which can be entered.
  - The cliff houses will show scenes of Nilo's past for some background.

    - Some items in the house can be interacted with, and will show some text about Nilo's past.
    - The real Svartskogen toy can be found there.

  - The Svartskogen will then move out of the way, and the player can progress to the next area, the School House.
  - The Svartskogen will disappear once out of view, and can later be found in the hub area, the Bedrock Plains.

### Shadow Cave (Sub-Area)

A strangely dark cave pokes into the cliffside, and a shadowy enemy hides in the darkness. The player is unable to see in the cave, and a light is needed to explore it.

---

- A grappling hook is required to reach this area.
  - Dev Note: Maybe put the grappling hook in level 3? I'm not sure about the implementation of making the map visible from here. Is this possible?

## School House (Area 3)

Nilo's old school house, dredged from unpleasant memories. Dark narrow halls close in claustrophobically, and echoes of mocking laughter can be heard here. Overturned chairs and tables lay strewn in the classrooms, as if a tornado had blown through.

The Handler will test Nilo here, shadowy, grasping, inhuman hands bursting through the windows to batter at Nilo. Nilo will have to prove themselves ready to face the dangers in the Dream World.

---

- The school house is meant to convey discomfort and fear to the player. Enemies are infrequent and may jumpscape the player when they appear.
- There are several interactable items that indicate Nilo's unpleasant experience in school, with several bullies occasionally bothering Nilo.
  - Maybe drop some more hints of Nilo and Florence's relationship? Maybe how Florence stood up for Nilo against bullies?
- A classroom at the end of the hall is the boss arena, where the Handler will test Nilo.
  - The tables and chairs in this room are swept to the corners, and the room is larger than the others.
  - The boss fight starts with the Handler's arms bursting through the windows, swiping at Nilo.
  - After two phases, the arms will retract and the Handler will show themselves, explaining that they were testing Nilo.
  - They tell Nilo that the one who wrote the note is the Fellow Dreamer, and points Nilo to the next area and level of the game, the bridge to University Ruins.
    - The Handler will give Nilo a pair of shoes for a dash ability, allowing them to cross the bridge.
      - The bridge is in Solura Path.
    - The Handler will disappear once out of view.

### School Yard (Sub-Area)

**WIP**

## The Shorelines (Hidden Area)

A hidden area unlocked by having a key item from some later level (we'll decide this later). A small, peaceful beach lies at the edge of the island, where the river seen earlier flows off the edge of the island as a waterfall. (Tentative): This area is on the other side of the cliffs.
