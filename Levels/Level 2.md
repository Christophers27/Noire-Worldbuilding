# Level 2: University Ruins

Below Solura Island, in the foggy sea of the Dream World, lies the University Ruins, the second level of the game. The theme of the level is college, and the areas are drawn from Nilo's memories and experiences from that time, though somewhat more distorted and abstract than the first level. Deeper in the Dream World, the surroundings are no longer drawn from just Nilo's memories.

## Entrance Hall

The entrance of the university, with a large, grand staircase leading up to the second floor. Many doorways and hallways create a maze-like structure. It is pristine and well-kept, representing Nilo's initial hopeful outlook on college and a fresh start. The architecture is orderly and symmetrical, with a lot of natural light.

Ahead, on the first floor, is a long hallway with many doors, leading to the Dark Maze. As the player progresses, the hallway will become darker, more dilapidated and asymmetrical, with twists and turns. At a certain point, the player will be unable to return to the entrance hall, and will be forced to continue forward.

- The Counselor first appears here, and has a scripted fight with Nilo. The player cannot win, and the Counselor will disappear after the fight, leaving behind a clue on how to defeat them later in the game.
- The door at the top of the staircase, which leads to the rooms of the second floor, is locked. The player will return here after escaping the Dark Maze and Library, and will lead to the Counselor's Office.
- In the transition to the Dark Maze, the hallway will begin to have turns and blocked paths, requiring the player to go through various rooms with many doors to go forward.
  - The purpose of this is to make the player feel lost, and have a smooth transition to the Dark Maze area. 
  - At a certain checkpoint, the player will go through one of multiple doors that teleports them to the Dark Maze. I'm thinking the darkness can hide the area transition, and make it seem like the player is just going forward.

## Dark Maze

The dark, dilapidated hallways of the university, with many locked doors and blocked paths. The player must find a way to unlock the doors and unblock the paths to progress. A light-based weapon can be found here, allowing the player to fight shadow-based enemies and unlocking dark areas.

## Library

A large library, with many bookshelves and tables. A puzzle involving moving bookshelves to create a path to the next area.

## Counselor's Office

A small, dark room, with a desk and a chair. Here, Nilo is presented with two terrible choices, and must learn that sometimes, they must make their own choices. The office and preceeding hallway is an infinite loop, and only by making their own path can they escape.
