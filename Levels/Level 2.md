# Level 2: University Ruins

Below Solura Island, in the foggy sea of the Dream World, lies the University Ruins, the second level of the game. The theme of the level is college, and the areas are drawn from Nilo's memories and experiences from that time, though somewhat more distorted and abstract than the first level. Deeper in the Dream World, the surroundings are no longer drawn from just Nilo's memories.

## Entrance Hall

The bridge from Solura Path leads to a long, winding staircase, descending into the foggy sea, before ending in front of the entrance to the university. A large, imposing building, with a set of double doors that open into the entrance hall.

Inside, the hall is large and open, with carpeted floors and high ceilings. A grand staircase leads to the second floor, though the door at the top is locked. The building is full of winding hallways and many doors, rooms leading to more rooms, creating a maze-like structure. The architecture is initially orderly and symmetrical, full of natural light, though as the player progresses, the building will become darker, more dilapidated and asymmetrical, with twists and turns.

Past the staircase is the first hallway leading to the aforementioned Dark Maze, where the architecture worsens as they proceed. Past a certain checkpoint, the player will have to pass a door that will not allow them to return to where they came from, and will be forced to continue forward.

- The Counselor first appears here (outside the building), and has a scripted fight with Nilo. The player cannot win, and the Counselor will disappear after the fight, leaving behind a clue on how to defeat them later in the game.
- The door at the top of the staircase, which leads to the rooms of the second floor, is locked. The player will return here after escaping the Dark Maze and Library, and will lead to the Counselor's Office.
- In the transition to the Dark Maze, the hallway will begin to have turns and blocked paths, requiring the player to go through various rooms with many doors to go forward.
  - The purpose of this is to make the player feel lost, and have a smooth transition to the Dark Maze area.
  - At a certain checkpoint, the player will go through one of multiple doors that teleports them to the Dark Maze. I'm thinking the darkness can hide the area transition, and make it seem like the player is just going forward.

## Dark Maze

<!-- The dark, dilapidated hallways of the university, with many locked doors and blocked paths. The player must find a way to unlock the doors and unblock the paths to progress. A light-based weapon can be found here, allowing the player to fight shadow-based enemies and unlocking dark areas. -->

The maze-like hallways and rooms of the inner university, with many locked doors and dead ends. The maze is dimly lit, with flickering or broken lights, and the walls and rooms are dilapidated and run-down. As the player progresses, they will feel more and more lost, reflecting Nilo's feelings at the time. Various shadow-type enemies can be found here, and initially, the player will be unable to damage them, and feel powerless like Nilo did. However, unlike Nilo in the past, the player will find a light-based weapon, and begin to fight back against the darkness.

## Library

A large library, with many bookshelves and tables. A puzzle involving moving bookshelves to create a path to the next area.

## Counselor's Office

A small, dark room, with a desk and a chair. Here, Nilo is presented with two terrible choices, and must learn that sometimes, they must make their own choices. The office and preceeding hallway is an infinite loop, and only by making their own path can they escape.
