# Level 2: University Ruins

Below Solura Island, in the foggy sea of the Dream World, lies the University Ruins, the second level of the game. The theme of the level is college, and the areas are drawn from Nilo's memories and experiences from that time, though somewhat more distorted and abstract than the first level. Deeper in the Dream World, the surroundings are no longer drawn from just Nilo's memories.

## Entrance Hall

The entrance of the university, with a large, grand staircase leading up to the second floor. Many doorways and hallways create a maze-like structure.

---

- The Counselor first appears here, and has a scripted fight with Nilo. The player cannot win, and the Counselor will disappear after the fight, leaving behind a clue on how to defeat them later in the game.

## Dark Maze

The dark, dilapidated hallways of the university, with many locked doors and blocked paths. The player must find a way to unlock the doors and unblock the paths to progress. A light-based weapon can be found here, allowing the player to fight shadow-based enemies and unlocking dark areas.

## Library

A large library, with many bookshelves and tables. A puzzle involving moving bookshelves to create a path to the next area.

## Counselor's Office

A small, dark room, with a desk and a chair. Here, Nilo is presented with two terrible choices, and must learn that sometimes, they must make their own choices. The office and preceeding hallway is an infinite loop, and only by making their own path can they escape.
