# The Dream World

## Summary

The Dream World is an alternate dimension that exists parallel to the Waking World. For whatever reason, when people fall asleep, they find themselves in the Dream World, in the First Layer. There, they arrive on their own island, which is shaped by their subconscious mind, and they experience their dreams. Most people are not lucid in the Dream World, only ever staying in the First Layer to experience their dreams every night. However, there are many layers to the Dream World, where creatures born from the dreams and nightmares of all who have ever slept reside, where the lines between imagination and reality blur.

The Dream World is inspired by the theory of Carl Jung's ['Collective Unconscious'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious), which is the idea that all humans share a collective unconscious that surrounds the unconscious mind of each individual, distinct from the personal unconscious, another psychological concept. The Dream World is the manifestation of the unconscious, with the island in the First Layer being the personal unconscious, and the lower layers being the sea that surrounds them, the collective unconscious. Landscapes and creatures in the Dream World are inspired by the 'instincts' and 'archetypes' that Jung brings up in his theory.

## Dreamers

While most people are not lucid when they enter the Dream World, there are a lucky few who remain conscious and aware of their surroundings. These people are called Dreamers, who possess the rare ability to freely roam the Dream World, exploring the many layers, interacting with the creatures that live there, and even gaining powers of their own.

Dreamers are able to enter the Dream World whenever they fall asleep, and return to the Waking World when they become too lucid, or fall unconscious. However, Dreamers must be careful not to be stuck and unable to become lucid or fall unconscious, as their bodies will not wake up as long as they are in the Dream World. Their bodies will remain in a coma-like state, and they will eventually die if they do not manage to escape.

## Layers

The Dream World can be likened to a vast sea, with many islands on its surface. The islands are the First Layer, representing each individual's personal unconscious, and the sea is the lower layers, representing the collective unconscious. Each person's island is unique and shaped by their subconscious mind, but can be influenced by the collective unconscious.

The actual appearance of the Dream World is a sea of clouds, on top of which the islands float. The sea is seemingly endless, and the islands are scattered across it.
