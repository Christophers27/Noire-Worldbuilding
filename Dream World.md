# The Dream World

## Summary

The Dream World is the dreamscape of humanity, the dreams and nightmares of all given form. It is the place where you go when you sleep, and experience your dreams. Those who hold on to their dreams are able to explore the Dream World, and are called Dreamers. They wander the many layers of the Dream World, shaped by imagination and the collective unconscious of humanity. There Dreamers may find the Dream Folk, born from the dreams of humanity, and the Nightmares, born from the fears and anxieties of humanity.

Once, the Dream World was a vibrant, living and breathing world, where the Dream Folk built their kingdoms and prospered. All of humanity was once able to walk the Dream World as Dreamers. However, as time passed, more and more people began to abandon their dreams for the demands of the real world, and were unable to Dream. With less and less Dreamers, the Dream World began to be forgotten and fade away. The fog began to spread across the Dream World, like an old memory becomes foggy and details are distorted or forgotten. The Dream Folk were consumed by the fog, twisted, changed or disappeared. Their kingdoms fell into ruin as the Nightmares began to overrun the Dream World. Fewer and fewer people were able to Dream, and the Dream World became a lonely, empty place.

## Dreamers

The rare few who still Dream, able to stay lucid in their dreams and explore the Dream World. They are able to leave their island and explore the foggy sea of the collective unconscious that surrounds it, roaming the many layers of the Dream World.

## The Fog

"It came slowly and silently, like an old memory is quietly forgotten. As the Dream World was forgotten by man, the fog began to spread across the Dream World. It trawled through the kingdoms, swallowing everything in its path. Everything, everyone it touched, was changed, or worse, disappeared. Even now, I can still hear the echoes of the Dream World's past, the cries of the creatures that were swallowed by the fog. I sometimes find pictures of myself with other smiling faces, but no names, no memories, come to mind. I shudder to think what happened to them." - The Handler

The Dream World was born from humanity's knowledge and imagination, and it will fade away by the lack of it. The fog is the lack of knowledge and imagination, an emptiness that changes, distorts, and erases memories and dreams. It is a natural force that changes and erases, but it makes way for new things to be born.

The fog is , in a way, the main antagonist of the game. It is the cause of the collapse of the Dream World, exerting a strange magnetic pull towards people, presenting an alluring temptation to simply give up, forget everything, and let the fog take them.

## The Dream Folk (Name Pending)

They are one of the two main inhabitants of the Dream World, created by fragments of the dreams people have. They built their kingdoms and prospered, but humanity began to abandon their dreams and forget the Dream World, and the fog encroached their kingdoms, changing them, or worse, making them disappear.

## The Nightmares

The other main inhabitants of the Dream World, born from the fears and anxieties of humanity. At first, the kingdoms of the Dream Folk were able to keep them at bay, but as the Dream Folk were consumed by the fog, they were unable to withstand the Nightmares, and the Nightmares began to overrun the Dream World.
