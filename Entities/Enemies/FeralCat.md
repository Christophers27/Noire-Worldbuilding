# Feral Cat

## Introduction

A small, but vicious cat. It's agile, but will generally leave Nilo alone, unless provoked. In that case, it will run at Nilo, and attack once it gets in melee range.

**Moves**:

The feral cat will scratch Nilo with its claws. Each scratch attack will not deal much damage, but
there will be a short cooldown between attacks.
