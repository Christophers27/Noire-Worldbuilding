## Elite Lanternfly

A stronger version of the lanternfly, twisted by the fog. It is larger and more imposing, moving faster to slash at Nilo with its longer claws.

- Claw Attack II: When the player is detected, the lanternfly makes a short dash towards them to attack them. If the dash does not make the player in range of attack, the lanternfly will keep moving at a slightly faster speed. When within range, it does two slashes with its claws (short time to react)

## Exploding Lanternfly

This lanternfly has an especially fiery lantern and a short temper. It rushes towards the player once seen, before exploding.

- Explode: When the player is detected, the lanternfly makes a short dash towards them to attack them. If the dash does not make the player in range of attack, the lanternfly will keep moving at a faster speed. When within range, it will slow down and explode after a short time.
