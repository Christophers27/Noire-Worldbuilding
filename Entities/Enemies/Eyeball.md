# Eyeball

A floating eyeball. Represents Nilo's anxiety. A major issue in their life, and a stronger enemy. Stronger versions of this enemy can be found in many proceeding levels in the game.

Does ranged attacks (eye laser). Bit hard to dodge, later versions might have shorter warning before attacking, attacking faster, melee attacks, and so on.
