# Svartskogen

A giant stuffed animal bear that was one of Nilo's childhood toys. It provided comfort to Nilo
as a child. They are guarding a bridge in Solura Valley.

Nilo feels a sense of nostalgia for their childhood toy as they haven't seen Svartskogen
in years. They are also frustrated that Svartskogen is now getting in their way.

I haven't seen Svartskogen in so long. I've really missed them over the years. 
But why is it getting in my way?
