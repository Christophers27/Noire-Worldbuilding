# Svartskogen

A giant stuffed bear that was one of Nilo's childhood toys. A gift from Florence, it was a source of comfort to Nilo as a child. In the Dream World, Svartskogen's leg is torn, blocking the bridge to the next area. Nilo feels a sense of nostalgia for their childhood toy as they haven't seen Svartskogen in years. They are also frustrated that Svartskogen is now getting in their way.

"I haven't seen Svartskogen in so long. I've really missed them over the years. But why is it getting in my way?" - Nilo (Journal Entry)
