# Nilo

## Introduction

- The main character, referred to as Nilo, has a purposefully vague gender and appearance, so any player can relate to them.
- Nilo struggles with anxiety and depression, and is initially unable to move on from their past mistakes and regrets.
- Their parents are likely distant or absent, and they have no siblings.

## History

### Early Childhood

- Some time in their early childhood, they met and befriended the Fellow Dreamer, Florence, who defended them from some bully in school.
- They stuck around Florence and followed her around, and she was the one to take the lead in difficult situations.
- Florence often attempted to help Nilo with their anxiety, though without much success. This was a source of guilt for Nilo, as they felt that they were a burden to Florence.
- Nilo admired Florence, and looked up to her as a role model, and aspired to be like her.
- Nilo's lack of progress frustrated Florence, and eventually led to them growing apart, which Nilo took very hard.
- Florence's fall into a coma was a major turning point in Nilo's life, and seeing her stay in the coma for so long caused Nilo to believe that she would never wake up.
  - Nilo felt regret that they were not able to make amends with Florence before she fell into the coma, and that they were not able to help her in any way.
- Nilo's anxiety began to worsen after this, and they began to struggle with depression as well.

### College

- Nilo initially went to college to try to have a fresh start, feeling hopeful that they could leave their past behind.
- Over time, they began to feel overwhelmed by the pressure of college, and began to doubt their choice of major.
- They felt more lost over time, and looked to their counselor for guidance, but the counselor could not help them and could only offer them two undesirable options.
  - Though no fault of the counselor, Nilo felt somewhat betrayed by them, and felt that they were not able to help them.
- Nilo eventually dropped out of college, feeling worse than ever.

### Present

- The beginning of the game takes place soon after Nilo drops out of college, at their lowest point in life.
- Nilo starts out feeling hopeless after so many failures, which is reflected in the game's journal entries. Their anxiety causes them to believe that they are a burden to everyone around them, and they still haven't gotten over Florence's perceived death by permanent coma.
- Throughout the first level, Nilo will face their childhood issues, and will gradually begin to accept that they can't change the past, though they will still struggle with their anxiety and depression.
- Their growing hope that Florence might still be alive will start to motivate them to keep going, shown in the entries in the quest log. Though still anxious, they will begin to build up determination to find Florence and make amends with her.
- The second level is where Nilo will truly begin to heal, facing their failures in college and coming to terms with them. They will confront a dream version of their counselor, and will be able to forgive them and themselves, and learn to make their own choices. They will also begin to feel more confident and self-assured, and will start to believe that they can make a difference in the world.

## Progression

- Throughout the game, The Dreamer encounters various regrets, fears, and other challenges to overcome.
- Each encounter allows The Dreamer to reconcile with their regrets, face their fears, and gradually become more confident and self-assured, much like the Fellow Dreamer that they looked up to.
- At the beginning of the game, The Dreamer will find the note left by the Fellow Dreamer's Shard, which is a brief introduction to the Dream World, and a hint at where to go next.
  - They will not know who left the note at first, but they will gradually piece together the clues and realize that it was their old friend.
