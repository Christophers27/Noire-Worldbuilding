# Nilo, The Dreamer

## Introduction

Nilo is the main character of the story, and the player character. Shy and anxious, they are a young adult who struggles with anxiety and depression, and is initially unable to move on from their past mistakes and regrets. Nilo is purposefully designed to be vague so the player can better relate to them.

## History

### Early Childhood

Nilo first met the Fellow Dreamer, Florence, at a young age in school, where they initially were just acquaintances. However, Florence seemed to not mind Nilo's shy and anxious nature, and eventually told them about her adventures in the Dream World. Nilo was fascinated by her stories, and asked she could tell them more. Being the first person to believe her about the Dream World, Florence was overjoyed to have someone to share her experiences with, and the two quickly became close friends.

Florence was happy to help Nilo with their anxiety, and usually took the lead in difficult situations, speaking up when Nilo was too anxious to do so. Nilo began to look up to Florence as a role model. However, Florence's attempts to help Nilo with their anxiety were not very helpful, as it was detrimental to Nilo's growth. Over time, Florence grew to realize this, and tried to let Nilo handle things on their own. However, when Nilo noticed this, they misinterpreted it as Florence being frustrated with them and trying to distance herself, and took it very hard, feeling abandoned.

Their anxiety grew, and this culminated in a confrontation with Florence, where Nilo's anxiety caused them to accidentally lash out at her, telling her that she was abandoning them for her make-believe world. Florence was hurt by this, feeling betrayed as Nilo was the only person to believe her about the Dream World. She responded by telling Nilo that she was tired of trying to help them, and stormed off. She went to the Dream World to escape from the confrontation, and her distraction caused her to be defeated by a Nightmare while exploring, putting her in a coma.

Meanwhile, Nilo, having cooled down, realized how much they had hurt Florence, went to apologize, only to find that she had fallen into a coma. Nilo was devastated, and waited anxiously for her to wake up, but she remained in a coma for a long time. In the first few weeks, Nilo visited her regularly, waiting for her to wake up. Then, they tried to study her condition and find a way to wake her up, but to no avail. After a few years had passed, Nilo began to lose hope that she would ever wake up, and regretted that they were not able to make amends with Florence. This event caused Nilo's anxiety to worsen, and they began to struggle with depression as well.

### College

Years later, Nilo went to college, thinking to have a fresh start. They decided to go for a field they thought was interesting and that they were passionate about, but over time, began to feel overwhelmed by the pressure of college, and doubted their choice to major in that field. Feeling lost, they looked to their counselor for guidance, but the counselor could only present them with two undesirable options. Though no fault of the counselor, Nilo felt betrayed with the lack of help, and eventually dropped out of college, feeling worse than ever.

### Present

The game begins soon after Nilo drops out of college, at their lowest point in life. Nilo starts out feeling hopeless after so many failures, which is reflected in the game's journal entries. Their anxiety causes them to believe that they are a burden to everyone around them, and they still haven't gotten over Florence's perceived death by permanent coma.

Throughout the first level, Nilo will face their childhood issues, and will gradually begin to accept that they can't change the past, though they will still struggle with their anxiety and depression. Their growing hope that Florence might still be alive will start to motivate them to keep going, shown in the entries in the quest log. Though still anxious, they will begin to build up determination to find Florence and make amends with her. The relevation of Florence's possible survival at the end of the first level gives Nilo a new sense of hope and purpose.

The second level is where Nilo will truly begin to heal, facing their failures in college and coming to terms with them. They will confront a dream version of their counselor, and will be able to forgive them and themselves, and learn to make their own choices. They will also begin to feel more confident and self-assured, and will start to believe that they can make a difference in the world.

**Third Level WIP**

## Personality

Nilo is shy and anxious, often feeling overwhelmed by their anxiety, which causes them to be unable to speak up or be frozen in place. Due to their past with Florence, they are also prone to thinking that they are a burden to others, and easily feel guilty or abandoned.

At first, they feel as if their many past regrets weigh down on them, and is unable to move on. However, as the game progresses, they will gradually begin to make peace with their past, and will learn to forgive themselves and others. This will be reflected in their journal entries, which will start to show a growing sense of hope and determination.
