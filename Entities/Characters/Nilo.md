# Nilo

Nilo is the main character of the story, and the player character. They are a young adult who struggles with anxiety and depression, and is initially unable to move on from their past mistakes and regrets. Nilo is purposefully designed to be vague so the player can better relate to them.

## History

### Early Childhood

Nilo met and befriended the Fellow Dreamer, Florence, in their early childhood, who stood up for them against a bully in school. They often followed Florence around, who handled difficult situations and attempted to help Nilo with their anxiety, though without much success. This was a source of guilt for Nilo, as they felt that they were a burden to Florence.

Over time, Florence grew frustrated with Nilo's lack of progress, and though she never voiced it, it eventually led to them growing apart. Nilo took this very hard, as they admired Florence and looked up to her as a role model.

Some time later, Florence fell into a coma, and despite Nilo's efforts in studying her condition and attempting to wake her up, she remained in the coma for a long time. Eventually, Nilo began to lose hope that she would ever wake up, and regretted that they were not able to make amends with Florence. This event caused Nilo's anxiety to worsen, and they began to struggle with depression as well.

### College

Years later, Nilo went to college, thinking of it as a fresh start. They decided to major in a subject they were passionate about, but over time, began to feel overwhelmed by the pressure of college, and doubted their choice of major. Feeling lost, they looked to their counselor for guidance, but the counselor could not help them and could only offer them two undesirable options. Though no fault of the counselor, Nilo felt betrayed with the lack of help, and eventually dropped out of college, feeling worse than ever.

### Present

The game begins soon after Nilo drops out of college, at their lowest point in life. Nilo starts out feeling hopeless after so many failures, which is reflected in the game's journal entries. Their anxiety causes them to believe that they are a burden to everyone around them, and they still haven't gotten over Florence's perceived death by permanent coma.

Throughout the first level, Nilo will face their childhood issues, and will gradually begin to accept that they can't change the past, though they will still struggle with their anxiety and depression. Their growing hope that Florence might still be alive will start to motivate them to keep going, shown in the entries in the quest log. Though still anxious, they will begin to build up determination to find Florence and make amends with her. The relevation of Florence's possible survival at the end of the first level gives Nilo a new sense of hope and purpose.

The second level is where Nilo will truly begin to heal, facing their failures in college and coming to terms with them. They will confront a dream version of their counselor, and will be able to forgive them and themselves, and learn to make their own choices. They will also begin to feel more confident and self-assured, and will start to believe that they can make a difference in the world.
