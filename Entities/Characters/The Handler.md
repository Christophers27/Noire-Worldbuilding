# The Handler

A mysterious figure who Nilo encounters at various points in their adventure. He occasionally gives Nilo advice and guidance, but his true motives seem unclear.

He once traveled with Florence for a time, having been a friend of hers before she was trapped in the lower layers of the Dream World. He is determined to restore the Dream World to its former glory, and is eager to get Nilo to rescue Florence. He might not agree with Nilo's decisions if the player chooses to take certain paths.

## History

### Pre-Collapse

Before the Dream World began to fade and its kingdoms collapsed, the Handler was a humble shopkeeper in the Liminal City, selling goods made from Dream Shards. He loved the city and its people, which made it all the more painful when the city began to fall apart. When the inhabitants of the city began to be twisted by the fog, the Handler was one of the few who managed to escape, and now he wanders the upper layers of the Dream World, trying to find a way to restore it to its former glory.

He was not fully able to escape the fog, and it has twisted his body into a more monstrous form, with eerie shadowy arms that can elongate and stretch. He wears a cloak to hide his appearance, and a mask to hide his face.

### Post-Collapse

Many years after the collapse, the Handler met Florence, as she was adventuring. They traveled together for a time, and Florence aided the Handler in restoring small parts of the Dream World, rescuing others, and so on. However, the Handler was unable to accompany Florence to the lower layers, so when she was trapped there, he was unable to help her.

### Present

The Handler has been waiting for someone new to come along and help him in his quest to restore the Dream World. When he detected Nilo's arrival, he decided to guide and prepare them for the trials ahead. He also recognized Nilo from Florence's stories, and was eager to get them to rescue Florence.

## Personality

The Handler is typically kind and helpful, though he can be stubborn and single-minded when it comes to his quest of restoring the Dream World. He is also haunted by the fall of the Liminal City and the loss of his friends, and is terrified of the fog, and resents the Nightmares for what they have done to the Dream World.
