# Florence, The Fellow Dreamer

## Introduction

Florence is Nilo's childhood friend, and seems to be the only person who holds on to her dreams and can explore the Dream World. She is an outgoing, cheerful girl with a penchant for helping others and a dream for adventure. Despite no one else believing her, she is determined to find the truth about the mysterious Dream World only she can see. Nilo is her closest friend, as the only one who believes her about the Dream World. After a falling out with Nilo, she went to the Dream World to escape from the confrontation, and her distraction caused her to be defeated by a Nightmare while exploring, trapping her in the Dream World and falling into a coma in the real world.

## History

### Early Childhood

At a young age, Florence discovered that when she slept, she could enter a mysterious world that she called the Dream World. Having dreamed of becoming an adventurer, she was overjoyed to have found a place where she could live out her dreams. In the real world, she was excited to share her experiences with her friends, but no one else believed her, telling her that she was just having vivid dreams, or making things up. She was disappointed, but she didn't let it get to her, and continued to explore the Dream World.

She first met Nilo in school, and seeing them alone and uncomfortable, decided to approach them and make friends. She didn't mind Nilo's shy and anxious nature, and eventually decided to tell them about her adventures in the Dream World. Nilo was fascinated by her stories, and asked she could tell them more. Being the first person to believe her about the Dream World, Florence was overjoyed to have someone to share her experiences with, and the two quickly became close friends. She also decided to help Nilo with their anxiety, and usually took the lead in difficult situations, speaking up when Nilo was too anxious to do so. Nilo began to look up to Florence, and noticing this, felt a sense of responsibility to be a good role model for Nilo.

### Highschool / The Coma

Some time during this period, Florence met the Handler during her adventures in the Dream World. Glad to have found someone in the Dream World who could understand her, she decided to befriend him and travel with him, helping him with his quest to restore the Dream World. She herself had started to focus on her goal of finding the truth about the Dream World, puzzled by the fact that she seemed to be the only one who could go there. She was also determined to find a way to bring Nilo to the Dream World, so that they could share her adventures together.

In the real world, she realized that her attempts to help Nilo with their anxiety were not very helpful, as it was detrimental to Nilo's growth. Over time, she grew to realize this, and tried to let Nilo handle things on their own. However, when Nilo noticed this, they misinterpreted it as Florence being frustrated with them and trying to distance herself, and took it very hard, feeling abandoned. Their anxiety grew, and this culminated in a confrontation with Florence, where Nilo's anxiety caused them to accidentally lash out at her, telling her that she was abandoning them for her make-believe world. Florence was hurt by this, feeling betrayed as Nilo was the only person to believe her about the Dream World. She responded by telling Nilo that she was tired of trying to help them, and stormed off. She went to the Dream World to escape from the confrontation, feeling angry and hurt, and her distraction caused her to be defeated by a Nightmare while exploring, trapping her in a nightmare and falling into a coma in the real world.

### Present

While trapped in the nightmare, Florence had much time to think, and realized that she had been too focused on her own goals, and had neglected Nilo's feelings. She has been trying to find a way to escape from the nightmare, and make amends with Nilo. And after so many years, she finally found a way to pull Nilo into the Dream World using her powers as a Dreamer, and now awaits Nilo's arrival.

## Personality

Florence is outgoing and cheerful, happy to help others, and dreams of setting out to be an adventurer. She embodies the stereotypical hero, a contrast to Nilo, the protagonist. Being one of the few who still holds on to her dreams, she is a Dreamer and is able to explore the Dream World. She is determined to know more about the Dream World, and why she is the only one who can see it. She also wants to bring her friend Nilo to the Dream World, so they could experience her adventures together.
