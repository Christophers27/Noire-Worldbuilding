# The Dreamer

## Introduction

- The main character, referred to as "The Dreamer", has a purposefully vague gender and appearance, so any player can relate to them.
- They initially possess a hesitant, melancholic personality, and many regrets about their past.
- Their parents are likely distant or absent, and they have no siblings.

## History

### Early Childhood

- Some time in their early childhood, they met and befriended the Fellow Dreamer, who defended them from some bully in school.
- They stuck around the Fellow Dreamer and followed her around, and she was the one to take the lead in difficult situations.
- She fell into a coma at one point, and The Dreamer was devastated and lost without her.

### College

- The Dreamer's college experience was unpleasant, leading them to drop out.
- They felt that they chose the wrong major, but it was too late to change.
- They looked up to some authority figure, possibly an advisor, who tried to help them as best they could, but could not help The Dreamer change their major.
- They felt disappointed and possibly betrayed by this authority figure, although it may be undeserved.
  - In the game, The Dreamer will meet a Shard of this figure, which is The Dreamer's own perception of them, and eventually reconcile with them.

## Progression

- Throughout the game, The Dreamer encounters various regrets, fears, and other challenges to overcome.
- Each encounter allows The Dreamer to reconcile with their regrets, face their fears, and gradually become more confident and self-assured, much like the Fellow Dreamer that they looked up to.
- At the beginning of the game, The Dreamer will find the note left by the Fellow Dreamer's Shard, which is a brief introduction to the Dream World, and a hint at where to go next.
  - They will not know who left the note at first, but they will gradually piece together the clues and realize that it was their old friend.
